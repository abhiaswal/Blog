    <p>   Skiing in Auli, hot chocolate, piping hot Himalayan brunches and magnificent views of Uttarakhand, this elegant adventure town is a destination worth the trip.

        Auli is neither the largest nor highest mountain town in India nor an internationally recognized destination that you will find splashed on the cover of travel guides. But something about its authority as Indiaâ€™s premier ski resort destination contrives to make it a dream holiday in the mind of many adventurers. The closest definition of this hill station that was originally developed as a paramilitary station is reflected not in its snow-covered peaks, but the handful of local communities who played a key role in developing this place into what it is today. Crowned by acres of oak plantations, the magnificence can be best observed before sunrise on a clear day as the sunrise breaks through to reach the ground, illuminating everything in its path.
        
        While exploring this town is an experience that encompasses all the magic in itself, skiing is another chapter in the story of how this place came to be.
